## 1. Prerequisites and Setup

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Node.js v14+** (if you plan to run the web interface)

### Dependencies
- PyTorch  
- numpy  
- music21  
- midi2audio  
- pydub  
- Additional dependencies as listed in the main README.md

### Required Files and Directories

Ensure you have the following files in the `requiredFiles` folder:
- **Mapping files:** `note_to_int.pkl` and `int_to_note.pkl`
- **Trained model file:** e.g., `best_model_Gloss_0.0319.pth`
- **Training data:** `training_target.pkl`
- **Sound font file:** `FluidR3_GM.sf2`

Also, make sure that the directory `static/audio/mix` exists for storing the generated music files.

## 2. Running the Python Music Generation Script

This section explains how the Python script works and how to run it.

### What the Script Does

#### Loading Models and Mappings
- Loads the mapping files (`note_to_int.pkl` and `int_to_note.pkl`) using Python’s `pickle` module.
- Initializes the generator (`SmallMusicGenerator`) and discriminator (`SmallMusicDiscriminator`) models.
- Loads the pre-trained model weights from the checkpoint and sets the models to evaluation mode.

#### Generating a Music Sequence
- Randomly selects a seed sequence from the training inputs.
- Uses the `generate_sequence` function to extend the seed to a desired length (e.g., 500 tokens), based on a temperature parameter that controls the diversity of the output.

#### Converting Tokens to a Music21 Stream
- Converts the generated token sequence into a `music21` stream.
- The first three tokens set the tempo, key, and time signature.
- Subsequent tokens are converted into `Note`, `Chord`, or `Rest` objects via the `token_to_music21` function.

#### Exporting and Converting the Music File
- The music stream is saved as a MIDI file to `static/audio/mix/generated_music.mid`.
- The MIDI file is then converted to WAV format using `midi2audio` (with FluidSynth and the provided sound font).
- Finally, the WAV file is converted to MP3 using the `pydub` library, and saved as `static/audio/mix/generated_music.mp3`.

### How to Run the Script

Open your terminal and execute the script with the following command:
python your_script_name.py


Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file. Once executed, the script will load the models, generate the music, and create the MIDI, WAV, and MP3 files in the appropriate directories.

## 2.1. Additional Training Instructions

The file `GenerateMusicFinal.ipynb` is responsible for training the model weights and extracting the necessary files:
- `note_to_int.pkl` and `int_to_note.pkl`
- `best_model_Gloss_0.0319.pth`
- `training_target.pkl`

You should run this notebook to generate new or improved versions of these files. (I will upload the main files that were initialized during the training process.)

**Important:**  
Due to the heavy computational processes involved, it is crucial to initialize the GPU before starting the training. Preferably, use an A100 GPU; however, a T4 is also acceptable. **Note:** When the GPU is initialized, training should commence immediately. If the GPU remains initialized without being actively used for training, computational resources are wasted at an approximate rate of 8.46 per hour. GPU usage is only relevant during the training process.

## 3. Web Integration: Using the HTML/CSS Interface

In addition to the Python script, the project includes a web interface built with HTML and CSS. This allows users to generate music directly through a browser.

### Components of the Web Interface

#### HTML
- Contains the structure of the webpage with elements such as a "Generate Music" button.

#### CSS
- Provides styling to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.

#### Static Files
- Generated music files (MP3) are stored in `static/audio/mix` and linked appropriately within the web interface.

### Example Integration with Flask

To bridge the Python backend with your web front-end, you can set up a simple API using Flask. Below is an example:




#### How It Works:
- **User Interaction:** When a user visits your website and clicks the "Generate Music" button, a GET request is sent to the `/generate` endpoint.
- **Backend Processing:** The Flask server calls the `main()` function from your Python script to generate the music.
- **Response:** Once the music is generated, the MP3 file is sent back to the browser, where it can be played or downloaded.

#### User Instructions on the Website
- **Access the Website:** Open the URL where the site is hosted.
- **Generate Music:** Click the "Generate Music" button.
- **Processing:** Wait while the server generates the music file.
- **Playback/Download:** The generated MP3 will either play automatically or be available for download through the interface.

## 4. Troubleshooting and FAQs

### Common Issues and Their Solutions

#### File Loading Errors
- Ensure all files in the `requiredFiles` folder exist and that the paths in the script are correct.
- Verify that file permissions allow reading the pickle files.

#### Dependency Problems
- Double-check that all required Python libraries (PyTorch, numpy, music21, midi2audio, pydub) are installed and compatible with your Python version.

#### Conversion Errors
- Confirm that FluidSynth is installed and that the `FluidR3_GM.sf2` sound font is available.
- Ensure the `static/audio/mix` directory exists for file storage.

#### Web Integration Issues
- Make sure your Flask (or equivalent) server is running.
- Verify that the endpoint paths in your HTML match those in the Flask app.

Below is a summary of all dependencies required to run generateMusic.py successfully:

Python Version
Python 3.10 or 3.11 (Ensure you're not using Python 3.13 as many packages like PyTorch are not yet compatible.)
pip install "numpy<2"

torch, torchvision, torchaudio
Install using the official PyTorch CPU wheels (adjust if you require GPU support).
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu


music21
For processing and converting music data (e.g., converting token sequences to MIDI).
pip install music21

midi2audio
For converting MIDI files to WAV using FluidSynth.
pip install midi2audio


pydub
For converting WAV files to MP3.
pip install pydub


External Dependencies:
FluidSynth is used by midi2audio for MIDI to WAV conversion.
On macOS, install via Homebrew:
brew install fluidsynth


SoundFont:
You must provide a valid SoundFont file (e.g., FluidR3_GM.sf2). Make sure the path to the SoundFont is correctly specified when initializing FluidSynth in your code.

ffmpeg
Required by pydub to process audio files.
On macOS, install via Homebrew:
brew install ffmpeg



Environment Setup
Virtual Environment:
It is recommended to create and activate a virtual environment (e.g., using python3.11 -m venv myenv) to ensure all dependencies are isolated.

Note:
Ensure the virtual environment is activated before installing packages.
If you encounter dependency conflicts (like with pip’s externally-managed-environment), consider using flags like --legacy-peer-deps or adjust your pip configuration.

By ensuring all these dependencies are installed and correctly configured, your generateMusic.py script should run without issues.





MUSIC Project Overview
The MUSIC Python project is comprised of several key files that work together to generate, serve, and play music based on AI models. Below is an overview of the primary files and their roles.


server.py
The server.py file serves several important functions:

Flask Server Initialization:
Acts as the entry point for running the Flask server, which handles incoming HTTP requests.

HTML Page Serving:
Provides access to the ui.html page so that users can interact with the application through their web browser.

Music Generation API Endpoint:
Defines an API endpoint (/generate) that executes an action (in this case, printing "hello" on the server) and returns a JSON response.

Port Configuration:
The server runs on a defined port (5003), which allows both local and external access to the application via a browser or API calls.

Overall, if you have a ui.html file that presents the user interface, server.py is essential for ensuring that users can access and interact with the UI and the underlying functionality.


models.py
The models.py file contains the definitions for our neural network models used in music generation and quality evaluation:

SmallMusicGenerator – Music Generator 🎶
Architecture:
A Transformer-based model that receives a sequence of musical tokens and predicts the subsequent tokens.

Components:

Embedding Layer: Converts input indices into vectors.
Positional Encoding: Adds positional information to maintain the sequence order.
Transformer Encoder: Processes the data through multiple layers.
Final Linear (fc) Layer: Transforms the latent representation back to predictions over the vocabulary (n_vocab).
SmallMusicDiscriminator – Music Discriminator 🧐
Architecture:
A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model designed to distinguish between real music (from the training data) and music generated by the generator.

Components:

Embedding Layer: Converts musical tokens into vectors.
Fully Connected Layers: Processes the embedding through several linear layers with LeakyReLU activations and dropout for gradual dimensionality reduction.
Final Output: Produces a single value (used with loss functions such as BCEWithLogitsLoss) to indicate the authenticity of the music.
Bottom Line:
The generator creates music, and the discriminator checks if the generated music “sounds real.” These models are used together in a GAN-like setup for AI-based music generation.






generateMusic.py
The generateMusic.py file is responsible for:

Loading Pre-trained Models and Data:
It loads the trained models (generator and discriminator) along with token mappings (e.g., note_to_int.pkl and int_to_note.pkl). It then sets the models to evaluation mode.

Generating a New Music Sequence:

Function: generate_sequence(generator, seed_sequence, target_length, sequence_length, n_vocab, temperature=1.0)
Takes a seed sequence from the training data.
Uses the generator to predict additional tokens until reaching the desired length.
The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the token selection.
Converting Tokens to a Music21 Stream:

Function: token_to_music21(token)
Converts textual tokens (e.g., NOTE_C4_1 or CHORD_60.64_2) into corresponding music21 objects (Note, Chord, or Rest).

Function: build_music21_stream(token_sequence)
Converts the token sequence into a music21.Stream.

The first three tokens set the tempo, musical key, and time signature.
The rest are processed into musical elements.
Saving Music in Multiple Formats:
After generating a new musical token sequence, the script converts it to various audio formats:

MIDI:
The music21 stream is saved as a .mid file in the static/audio/mix/ directory.
WAV:
Using FluidSynth (via midi2audio), the MIDI file is converted to a WAV file. A valid SoundFont (e.g., FluidR3_GM.sf2) must be provided.
MP3:
The WAV file is then converted to an MP3 file using pydub.
Main Function Workflow:

Loads the models and mappings.
Randomly selects a seed sequence from the training data.
Generates a new music sequence.
Constructs a MIDI file from the generated tokens.
Converts the MIDI file to WAV and then to MP3.
This file serves as the backbone for running our Transformer-GAN-based music generation process.









templates/ui.html
The ui.html file is a web page that provides an interactive user interface for music generation. It leverages several libraries and design tools:

Design Libraries:

TailwindCSS & DaisyUI:
For responsive and modern UI design.
Amplitude.js:
For managing audio playback and playlists.
Page Structure:

Navigation & Menus:
A top navigation bar with links such as Playlist, Favorite, Blog, etc.
A left-side menu displaying the search history of played songs (loaded from localStorage).
Mood Selection:
Cards representing different moods (e.g., Happiness, Sadness, Angry, Fear).
When a mood is selected, the corresponding card is highlighted and the "Generate" button is animated to prompt action.
Music Player (Amplitude.js):
Displays song details such as cover art, song name, artist, and album.
Includes controls for play/pause, previous, next, and a download icon.
Music Generation:
When the "Generate" button is pressed, the page:
Checks if a mood has been selected.
Stops any currently playing song.
Chooses a song URL based on the selected mood.
Initializes Amplitude.js with the selected song.
Favorites & Download:
Clicking the heart icon adds the song to a favorites list (stored in localStorage).
The download icon allows the user to download the MP3 file of the generated music.
Summary:

The ui.html page provides an interactive interface for users to choose a mood, generate music accordingly, listen to the generated music via Amplitude.js, view search history, and download their favorite tracks.
It combines modern design (via TailwindCSS/DaisyUI) with audio playback functionality (Amplitude.js) to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.
